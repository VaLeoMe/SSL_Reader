# SSL_Reader
## Introduction

SSL Reader is a utility application designed to retrieve and display SSL certificate information of websites. It is a handy tool for those working with website security, IT auditing, network troubleshooting, or anyone simply interested in learning more about the SSL certificates a site uses.
## Functionality

When provided with a website's URL, SSL Reader establishes a secure connection to the site, retrieves its SSL certificates, and then presents a detailed overview of these certificates.

This can be incredibly useful for a number of scenarios, such as:

- Verifying the authenticity and validity of the certificates a site uses.
- Troubleshooting connection or security issues related to SSL/TLS.
- Learning more about the security measures a site has implemented.

## Quick Start

To use SSL Reader, simply clone the repository, compile and run the application, and follow the prompts. You'll need to provide the URL of the website you're interested in, and the application will do the rest. Note that this application requires Java to run and it is recommended to use it in a development or testing environment first to ensure its compatibility with your system.
## Note

While SSL Reader is designed to work with most websites, please note that it may not be able to retrieve SSL certificates from websites that use non-standard configurations or security measures.
## Conclusion

SSL Reader is a simple but powerful tool for anyone who works with or is interested in website security. It provides an easy way to retrieve and inspect a site's SSL certificates, providing valuable insight into its security measures. Whether you're an IT professional, a developer, a student, or just a curious user, SSL Reader is a useful tool to have in your software toolkit.
